# 0x08. Making Change - README
Description
This project focuses on solving the classic "coin change problem" using algorithms such as greedy algorithms and dynamic programming. The objective is to determine the minimum number of coins required to meet a specific total using a given set of coin denominations.

The task is to write a function, makeChange(coins, total), that returns the fewest number of coins needed to meet the total. The function should also return special values for cases where it's impossible to meet the total with the given coins or when the total is zero.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Apply greedy algorithms and dynamic programming to optimization problems.
Analyze time and space complexity in algorithm design.
Implement and compare recursive and iterative solutions in Python.
Write efficient Python code for algorithmic problems.
